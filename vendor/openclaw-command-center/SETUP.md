# Command Center — Setup Instructions

This is the practical install flow for getting CommandCenter running without mystery failures.

## Security-first startup

- Open first-run setup from the Command Center host itself. Password creation is loopback-only.
- Use at least 12 characters. Login/setup attempts are throttled and changing the password invalidates prior sessions.
- Public `/api/v1` requests require `Authorization: Bearer <COMMANDCENTER_API_KEY>`.
- The optional local no-key API works only when the TCP peer is loopback and the request arrived on `LOCAL_API_PORT`; proxy headers do not affect this decision.
- `/ws` requires either the UI session cookie or an Authorization bearer header. Do not put credentials in WebSocket URLs.

On Windows, Python discovery tries `PYTHON_BIN`, `.venv\\Scripts\\python.exe`, `py -3`, `python3`, and `python`. Wake workers are optional and warm only when wake configuration exists.

## 1) Prerequisites

Verify:
- **Node.js 18+** — `node --version`
- **npm** — `npm --version`
- **OpenClaw CLI** — `openclaw --version` (needed for live OpenClaw mode)
- **Hermes CLI** — `hermes --help` (only needed if you want Hermes integration/bridge enabled)
- **ffmpeg** — required for audio normalization/transcription

If Node.js or ffmpeg is missing, install them first.

## 2) Install

```bash
npm ci
cp .env.example .env
```

(`npm install` is fine too, but `npm ci` is preferred for reproducible fresh-instance verification.)

## 2.5) Copy/paste quick start (demo mode)

```bash
npm ci && cp .env.example .env
sed -i 's/^DEMO_MODE=.*/DEMO_MODE=true/' .env
npm start
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`.

## 2.6) Copy/paste quick start (live mode, same host as OpenClaw)

```bash
npm ci && cp .env.example .env
sed -i 's/^DEMO_MODE=.*/DEMO_MODE=false/' .env
sed -i 's|^GATEWAY_URL=.*|GATEWAY_URL=ws://127.0.0.1:18789|' .env
sed -i 's/^GATEWAY_TOKEN=.*/GATEWAY_TOKEN=/' .env
npm start
```

Then verify status:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:3000/api/status
```

Expected output (minimum):
- `setup.mode` is `demo` (demo run) or `live` (live run)
- `setup.gatewayConnected` is `true` for live mode
- `setup.issues` is empty or only informational

If you want a public CommandCenter plus a same-machine automation API, also set:

```env
COMMANDCENTER_API_KEY=replace_me_with_a_real_secret
LOCAL_API_ENABLED=true
LOCAL_API_HOST=127.0.0.1
LOCAL_API_PORT=3001
```

That gives you:
- public/network API on `HOST:PORT` that requires `Authorization: Bearer <COMMANDCENTER_API_KEY>`
- local loopback API on `http://127.0.0.1:3001/api/v1/*` with no bearer token required

For same-machine apps, the usual first calls are:
- `GET /api/v1/agents`
- `POST /api/v1/sessions`
- `POST /api/v1/sessions/:id/messages`
- or `POST /api/v1/chat` if you want a simpler wrapper

## 3) Choose your mode first

This is the most important setup decision.

Also: Hermes and OpenClaw do **not** need separate CommandCenter installs. If you enable both, they can co-exist inside the same dashboard and the same merged roster.

### Demo mode
Use this if you just want to preview the UI.

```env
DEMO_MODE=true
```

What demo mode means:
- the interface works
- agent activity may be simulated
- OpenClaw does **not** need to be connected

### Live OpenClaw mode
Use this if you want real agents.

```env
DEMO_MODE=false
GATEWAY_URL=ws://127.0.0.1:18789
```

For live mode, CommandCenter needs a valid OpenClaw gateway token.

Good news: if CommandCenter is running on the same machine as OpenClaw, it now tries to auto-detect the token from `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` when `GATEWAY_TOKEN` is blank.

If that auto-detect fails for any reason, the Setup Status block should now say so clearly instead of pretending live mode succeeded.

If you want to set it manually, add:

```env
GATEWAY_TOKEN=your_openclaw_gateway_token_here
```

### Optional Hermes bridge integration

If you also want Hermes agents to appear in CommandCenter, enable the Hermes bridge:

```env
HERMES_BRIDGE_ENABLED=true
HERMES_BIN=hermes
```

What this does:
- CommandCenter asks the Hermes CLI for available profiles
- Hermes profiles are merged into the same office roster as OpenClaw agents
- Hermes session activity can be mirrored into the same Activity Log/office state stream

How detection works under the hood:
- OpenClaw agents come from `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` → `agents.list`
- Hermes agents come from `hermes profile list` plus `hermes profile show <profile>`
- both are normalized into the same roster shape used by `GET /api/v1/agents`
- each agent includes a `source` field (`openclaw` or `hermes`)
- `primaryAgentId` is chosen from the merged roster and is the safest default target for automations or super apps

This is additive, not exclusive.
You can run:
- OpenClaw only
- Hermes only
- both OpenClaw and Hermes together

## 3.5) Updater behavior

CommandCenter now includes a built-in updater in **Settings → Updates**.

What it gives you:
- **Auto update toggle** enabled by default
- manual **Update Now** button
- confirmation modal before the update actually applies
- pending commit list
- changed-file preview
- trimmed code diff preview
- latest commit message / release-note style text when available

Important behavior:
- updates are blocked if the local repo has uncommitted changes
- applying an update pulls from the repo, installs dependencies if needed, and restarts CommandCenter
- updater preferences/state are stored locally in `data/update-settings.json` and `data/update-state.json`

If you are preparing an instance for someone else, you usually do **not** need to preconfigure anything in `.env` for updates.
Just make sure the repo was cloned normally and the host can reach GitHub.

## 4) Voice setup

Voice is no longer just “paste OpenAI key.” There are separate input and output systems.

### Listening / STT
Choose one:
- **Local Whisper on this server**
- **AIChat STT API**

If using AIChat STT API, CommandCenter supports:
- Fish Audio STT
- OpenAI STT
- ElevenLabs STT

### Speaking / TTS
Choose one:
- **Fish Audio via AIChat tagged API**
- **ElevenLabs**
- fallback: **espeak-ng** if premium TTS is not configured

### Recommended default for Epic’s setup
- STT: **AIChat API → Fish Audio**
- TTS: **Fish Audio via AIChat**

Most voice configuration is done in the **Settings** UI after boot.

## 5) Start the server

```bash
npm start
```

## 6) Open the app

Visit:
- `http://localhost:3000`
- or `https://localhost:3000` if you generated certs

## 7) Read the setup status before testing voice

Open **Settings** and check the **Setup Status** block.

While you are there, open **Updates** once and make sure it can read the repo cleanly.
That panel should show whether you are:
- already up to date
- waiting on incoming commits
- blocked by local uncommitted changes
- or currently applying an update

It should tell you whether you are in:
- **Demo Mode**
- **Live Connected**
- **Demo Fallback**
- **Connecting**

You can also verify quickly via API:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:3000/api/status
```

Look at `setup.mode`, `setup.modeLabel`, `setup.gatewayConnected`, and `setup.issues`.

If live connection fails, CommandCenter should now make that obvious instead of quietly pretending everything is fine.

## 8) Common first-run problems

### UI looks alive, but agents are fake
You are probably in **demo mode** or **demo fallback**.

### Gateway auth failed
Your `GATEWAY_TOKEN` is wrong, stale, or missing.

Quick checks:
- If running on the same host as OpenClaw, leave `GATEWAY_TOKEN` blank and restart CommandCenter so auto-detect can run.
- If setting manually, ensure it matches OpenClaw `gateway.auth.token` exactly.
- Recheck status using `/api/status` and confirm whether mode is `live` or `demo-fallback`.

### Public API says key required
If you hit the public/network-facing `/api/v1` listener without configuring `COMMANDCENTER_API_KEY`, CommandCenter now returns `PUBLIC_API_KEY_REQUIRED`.

Quick fix:
- set `COMMANDCENTER_API_KEY` in `.env`
- restart CommandCenter
- keep local automation on `127.0.0.1:3001` if you want no-key same-machine access

### Updates panel says update blocked
That usually means the repo has local uncommitted changes.

Quick checks:
- run `git status --short`
- commit/stash/discard local edits first
- re-open **Settings → Updates** and refresh status

The updater is intentionally conservative here so it does not overwrite local work.

### Voice records but no transcript comes back
Usually one of these:
- STT provider is not configured
- AIChat STT base URL is wrong
- audio format was rejected upstream

### Agent replied in logs, but no audio played
Usually TTS is unconfigured or browser playback/autoplay got blocked.

## 9) Optional HTTPS certs

Only needed if your browser/device requires HTTPS:

```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout server/key.pem -out server/cert.pem -days 365 -nodes -subj '/CN=localhost'
```

## 10) What to report after setup

Tell the user:
- which URL the app is running on
- whether it is in **demo**, **live**, or **demo fallback** mode
- whether gateway auth succeeded
- which STT/TTS providers are selected
- whether voice was actually tested successfully
